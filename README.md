### What is Hypertime ?

The Wrapped Hypertime (WHyTe) is an enabling technology for long-term mobile robot autonomy in changing environments [[1](#references)], but is applicable to problems outside the robotics domain.
It allows to introduce the notion of dynamics into most spatial models used in the mobile robotics domain, improving the robots'' ability to cope with naturally-occuring environment changes.
Hypertime is based on an assumption that from a mid- to long-term perspective, some of the environment dynamics are periodic.
To reflect that, Hypertime models 
The idea builds on the success of the Frequency Map Enhancement ([FreMEn](http://fremen.uk)), which environment states by combination of periodic functions efficiently modelling periodic properties of the changes observed.
